replace the search button with recommend - make upload possible on template  - upload the images and get result straightway



\initial values shooudl be none 




integrate the page with the final images - from the user
by default show different values after updating change the values


the index page post method was not enabling me to send the post request 
images was not possible to send via form - as the path localhost was written there
which was not present on the instance

when I create a new instance or start or stop it
the ip changes everytime - i need a fixed ip

so I learned about elastic ip and created an ip for that
which enabled me to have the same instance with the same ip every time i create an instance

now its solved

have to show the image of the person + show products for which all this is done

change the dictionary of values for accurate methods data display
